# Intelligent Robotic Sonographer: 
## Mutual Information-based Disentangled Reward Learning from Few Demonstrations

#### Introduction
his work proposes an intelligent robotic sonographer to autonomously “explore” target anatomies and navigate a US probe to standard planes by learning from the expert. The underlying high-level physiological knowledge from experts is inferred by a neural reward function, using a ranked pairwise image comparisons approach in a self-supervised fashion. This process can be referred to as understanding the “language of sonography”.
